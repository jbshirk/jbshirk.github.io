This is my third test rig. The first two self-destructed. These magnets have a force of over 35 psi at zero distance. They bent my aluminum and shredded my plexiglass.

Demonstrates: 1) release of magnetic force, 2) advance to next station 3) didn't self-destruct this time

There's a lot of geometry to do:

And a lot of physics:
