I have a hobby blog called [Exospheric](https://js.ipfs.io/ipns/QmZJBQBXX98AuTcoR1HBGdbe5Gph74ZBWSgNemBcqPNv1W/). It's not your everyday kind of blog. It started as an expermiment in host-less web. Exospheric is hosted on the InterPlanetary FileSystem (IPFS) --it's everywhere and it's nowhere.

IPFS is a distributed, version-controlled, virtual filesystem that can replace HTTP and eliminate the dead link or deleted site problem. Also the seized Domain Name problem. IPFS is an important project and people need to know how to use it. 

I made the site with at-risk journalists in mind, to demonstrate that anyone can be an anonymous blogger. Anyone can make an unbreakable site that canâ€™t fail or be taken down. 


### my history

My carreer started as a Russian language translator in military intelligence. I'd tell you the rest, but you know what happens to people who know too much.
