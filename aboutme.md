At heart, I'm an inventor-philosopher. I desire to apply my data science skills to helping solve societal ills, particularly energy and resource sustainability, achievement of human potential, propaganda and disinformation, science capture, state capture, AI abuse, and data tyranny. These touch on a number of areas, such as social psychology, [economic psychology](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/The-Psycho-Linguistics-of-Sustainable-Economy-Q2y2fW9rE9WZbeZBNC2Rl), and geospacial resource discovery, inventory, and monitoring.

### Career history

My career started as a Russian linguist in military intelligence, primarily in the domains of science and aerospace engineering.

For a good 15 years I worked with SQL databases (primarily SQL Server): query writing, ETL, and data engineering.

For the last 10 years, I've also been doing volunteer work as a translator to and from Brazilian Portuguese.

### Hobbies
#### Exospheric unbreakable blog
I have a blog called [Exospheric](https://js.ipfs.io/ipns/QmZJBQBXX98AuTcoR1HBGdbe5Gph74ZBWSgNemBcqPNv1W/). It's not your everyday kind of blog. It started as an expermiment in host-less websites. Exospheric is hosted on the [InterPlanetary FileSystem](https://ipfs.io/) (IPFS) --it's everywhere and it's nowhere.

IPFS is a distributed, version-controlled, virtual filesystem that can replace HTTP and eliminate the dead link or deleted site problem. Also the seized Domain Name problem. IPFS is an important project and people need to know how to use it. 

I made the site with at-risk journalists in mind, to demonstrate that anyone can be an anonymous blogger. Anyone can make an unbreakable site that canâ€™t fail or be taken down. 

#### Polymagnetic motor 
I am also developing a permanent magnet motor, initially intended for bicycles and wheelchairs. If it proves successful, as my proof-of-concept tests suggest, it will require far fewer batteries, weigh less, and have greater range than electromagnetic motor products -just enough to power the small electromechanical actuators and microcontroller. 

Many academics believe permanent magnet motors are impossible. It's not impossible, just difficult. There are in fact a few working, patented permanent motors, such as this [reciprocating Permanent magnet drive apparatus](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8487484B1/en); my design is about [1000 pounds lighter and probably 100 times more efficient, since it eliminates reciprocation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoxyqxHYKBs). 

One of the difficulties with developing such things is good data collection and analysis. I hope to put my data science skills to work here.
